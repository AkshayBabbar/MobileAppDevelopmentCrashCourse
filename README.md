Mobile App Development Crash Course
===================================

ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP SERIES
---------------------------

You check your iPhone multiple times a day, and so do 575 million other people. This two-day workshop will help you start building applications for consumer’s most loved device.

Many of us have had ideas for mobile apps float through our minds, and it’s entirely possible one of your ideas could turn into something great — but without the knowledge of how to create a new app, it’s impossible for your idea to come to fruition.

By the end of this workshop, you will understand the steps and skills needed to build an iOS app from start to finish.
